description: "The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter. It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905.\
  \ Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog washerwoman who lives in a tiny cottage in the\
  \ fells of the Lake District. A child named Lucie happens upon the cottage and stays\
  \ for tea. The two deliver freshly laundered clothing to the animals and birds in\
  \ the neighbourhood. Potter thought the book would be best enjoyed by girls, and,\
  \ like most girls' books of the period, it is set indoors with a focus on housework.\n\
  Potter's pet hedgehog, Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, and Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman,\
  \ were the inspirations for the eponymous heroine. Lucie Carr, a child friend of\
  \ Potter's, was the model for the fictional Lucie. Potter's Peter Rabbit and Benjamin\
  \ Bunny make cameo appearances in the illustrations. The Newlands Valley and the\
  \ surrounding fells are the sources for the backgrounds in the illustrations.\n\
  Mrs. Tiggy-winkle has been described as one of Potter's most positive creations,\
  \ but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is\
  \ set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching\
  \ back to an age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid\
  \ of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone\
  \ fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside\
  \ and its way of life.\nMrs. Tiggy-winkle became a popular character and the subject\
  \ of considerable merchandise over the decades including nursery ware and porcelain\
  \ figurines. The tale has been published in braille and the Initial Teaching Alphabet,\
  \ and has been translated into French, German, and Dutch. In 1971, Mrs. Tiggy-winkle\
  \ became a character performed by Sir Frederick Ashton in the Royal Ballet film,\
  \ The Tales of Beatrix Potter. In 1993, the tale was adapted to animation and telecast\
  \ as an episode of the BBC series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.In the\
  \ world of Peter rabbit and friends the story was combined with the tale of Jeremy\
  \ Fisher, the 7th book in the series. This book, the tale of Mrs tiggy Winkle, is\
  \ the 6th book in the series. It is also the 6th book to be published.\n From Wikipedia\
